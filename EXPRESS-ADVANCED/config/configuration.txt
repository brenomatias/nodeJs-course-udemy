node packages out there for
managing configuration, the most popular one is rc


better way:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/config


So with this node package
we can easily see the default configuration as well as the configuration
in each environment, it's very clean, it gives you a very clean structure.

in index.js
'const config = require('conf');



 you should not store
the application secrets in these configuration files, for example you should not store
the password of your database or your mail server.
