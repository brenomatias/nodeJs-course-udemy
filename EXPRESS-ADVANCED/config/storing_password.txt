let's define an environment variable for storing the password of a mail
server. So export, password we set it to
1234. Now to prevent this environment variable clash
with another environment variable, it's better to prefix that with
the name of our application. Now in this demo, let's say the name of our application
is app. 

'export app_password=1234'


So we store all these passwords and secrets
in our environment variables, and then read them using our
config module. Now back in the project, in the
configuration folder, we need to add another file called custom
-environment
-variables. Make sure to spell it
properly the name of this file is very important.


custom-enviornment-variables.json. And in
this file, we define the mapping of configuration settings
to environment variables
