---- MiddlewareFunction
 
The Middleware function is basically a function that
takes a request object, and either returns a response to the client,
or passes control to another Middleware function.



- This example shows a middleware function with no mount path. The function is executed every time the app receives a request.

var express = require('express')
var app = express()

app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('Time:', Date.now())
  next()
})

- This example shows a middleware function mounted on the /user/:id path. The function is executed for any type of HTTP request on the /user/:id path.

app.use('/user/:id', function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('Request Type:', req.method)
  next()
})

- This example shows a route and its handler function (middleware system). The function handles GET requests to the /user/:id path.

app.get('/user/:id', function (req, res, next) {
  res.send('USER')
})
